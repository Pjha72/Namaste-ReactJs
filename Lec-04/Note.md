15. Is the Component Hoisted?
Ans : Yes, the component is hoisted in React. Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism that moves all variable and function declarations to the top of their scope. This means that you can use a component before you have declared it.
For example, you can create a component called App and then use it in another component called MyComponent before you have declared App. This is because the App component will be hoisted to the top of its scope.
