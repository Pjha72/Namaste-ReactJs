Q1 : What is Difference Between Libaray and Framework?
Ans : A library is a collection of precompiled routines, functions, and classes that can be used to perform specific operations or tasks. It provides a set of tools and utilities that can be called upon by an application to accomplish certain functionalities. When using a library, the control flow of the program remains within the application code, and the developer decides when and how to use the library's functionality.

On the other hand, a framework is a pre-built architecture that dictates the structure and flow of an application. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build applications by defining the overall structure and flow of the program. In contrast to a library, the control flow in a framework is inverted, meaning that the framework calls the application code rather than the other way around.

In summary, a library provides specific functions that can be called upon by an application, while a framework provides an overall structure and dictates the flow of an application.
